# Deployment Fix - Database Tables Issue

## Problem
- Application deployed on Vercel but player creation failed
- Error: `The table 'public.surveys' does not exist in the current database`
- Prisma migrations were not applied to Supabase database

## Root Cause
- New Supabase project was created but database schema (tables) were not created
- Prisma CLI commands were failing/interrupting during migration

## Solution
**Direct SQL execution in Supabase SQL Editor:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run the complete SQL schema (see below)
3. Tables created successfully: `players`, `surveys`, `questions`, `responses`, `answers`

## SQL Schema Used
```sql
-- Create enum type for QuestionType
CREATE TYPE "QuestionType" AS ENUM (
  'TEXT', 'NUMBER', 'EMAIL', 'SELECT', 'MULTIPLE_SELECT',
  'SCALE', 'BOOLEAN', 'BODY_MAP', 'RATING_SCALE', 'RPE',
  'SLIDER', 'TIME'
);

-- Create all tables with proper relationships
-- (Full schema was executed successfully)
```

## Result
✅ Player creation now works
✅ All database operations functional
✅ Application fully deployed and working

## Key Learning
When Prisma migrations fail, direct SQL execution in database admin panel is a reliable alternative for creating schema.
